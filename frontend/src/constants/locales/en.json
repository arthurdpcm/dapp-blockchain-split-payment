The main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of automating complex financial processes in a transparent and secure way using smart contracts.",
  "about_desc_2": "The application allows a user to make a payment in one stablecoin (like BRZ) and, automatically, the system performs a swap to another stablecoin (like USDC), calculates a fee on the transacted amount, sends this fee to a designated tax wallet, and transfers the remaining amount to the final recipient.",

  "tech_blockchain_desc": "The DApp proposes to run on the Polygon network, with local development facilitated by forking the mainnet via Anvil. Developed in Solidity, with the Hardhat framework for compilation, testing, and deployment. It uses the standard security contracts from OpenZeppelin.",
